Oh hey! What's your favourite Mass Affect character. Personally Ashleigh Williams has to take the top spot, but Tali T'Zorah is a close runner up. Anyway, welcome to your internship at Duck Inc. 
As you can see we specialize in AI, but we have made considerable innovation in certain other fields, despite our methods being criticized by some.... 
Anyway, let me run a demo of our cutting edge AI right now. Let me just log on to my console here... make all... stupid style checker... there we go! 

State: TalkAnvik Tree: Objective 

Well, you'll be helping me make adjustments to the AI to help us get closer to the perfect version. 
Well, there is some other research you could possibly help out with. 
It's more Nicole's area of expertise, but we do do some experiments in the field of Duckification. That's not important right now though.

I've been working here since the great 2720 incident of 22'. You were in that class right?
Yeah, it did a number on all of us. So I decided to move here and chase my passion, artificial intelligence.
I've been working on this project for years. This is an AI so advanced that it can completely simulate the functions of a human, you're at the forefront of tech here my friend

BLAM! The room goes dark.
Gosh darnit! I hate when this happens.
Could you go downstairs to the furnace room and flip the breaker? Go down the stairs to the basement, and it should be the second room on your left.
