## Project Overview

Kivna's Revenge is a terminal-based adventure game set within a 3x3 room grid. Players navigate through unique rooms, interact with objects, and face a reactive villain AI that tracks their movements based on noise levels. The game features branching narrative logic, immersive commands, and an inventory system for both the player and the rooms.

## Features

- **Player and Room Inventories:**  
  Manage items and interact with the environment using commands such as move, talk, listen, and item management.

- **Dynamic Villain AI:**  
  Reacts to noise generated by player actions, tracking the player and adding tension to gameplay with replayability.

- **Branching Narrative:**  
  Multiple story paths based on player decisions, increasing engagement and depth.

- **Software Engineering Principles:**  
  Designed with DRY and SOLID principles for maintainability and extensibility.  
  Modular class architecture supports clean, scalable code.  
  Supplemental UI diagrams guide system design and improve understanding.
